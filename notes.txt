- GOAL: add a meal that's pulled from the API to a user's profile
  - store saved meals in an array of objectIds called savedMeals that references the meals models



- there should be a button on the mealDetails page that, when clicked, takes the state of the meal and sends it to a profileService function that calls the backend /api/profiles router to make a post request to /:id/saveMeal

controller will locate user profile (using req.params.id) then push in the data provided by the front-end
